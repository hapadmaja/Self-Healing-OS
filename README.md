# Self-Healing-OS
This is a mini-project done as a attempt to mimic a part of a self- healing Operating system.
Here we have tried to detect few errors that occur in memory,disk etc. Also we have written a character device driver in C language and implemented it in Ubuntu OS
Among the files uploaded, makefile,apps.c,device_driver.c together form a module,first run the makefile with all the dependencies required.
Now you can link the apps.c with device_driver and compile the apps.c file to see the device driver working
The rest of the C files are self explanatory
